Assumptions:

1) Points like (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (1,1,2) can exist simultaneously which is why I always do a 2-d mapping 
  first. This add to time complexity

2) If points forming a lake are co-linear. Their area is equal to the number of points

3) IN THE THIRD PROBLEM , LAKES DONT EXIST AND ALL POINTS ARE POTENTIALLY "DRIVEABLE"

Steps to run:
 python lakes.py
