two dimensional array representation of an image can also be represented by a one dimensional array of W * H size, where W represet row and H represent column size and each cell represent pixel value of that image. You are also given a threshold X. For edge detection , you have to compute differnece of a pixel value with all its adjacent pixels and find the maximum of all differnces. And finally
compare if that maximum difference is greater than threshold X. If so, then the pixel is a edge pixel and have to display it.
