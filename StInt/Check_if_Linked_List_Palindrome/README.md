Check if a given linked list is palindromic in nature. 
There can be two approaches to this problem: 

1) Traverse the list and push every node onto a stack. Now, traverse the list from the beginning again and pop nodes of stack. Compare both node values. If the node values are the same, they are palindromic. 

2) Reverse the list and check if the values are still the same as those in a front traversal.
