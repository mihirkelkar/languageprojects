The time complexity can be reduced to O(n^2) by storing results of sub problems. The idea is similar to this post. We maintain a boolean table[n][n] that is filled in the the bottom up fasion. The value of table[i][j] is true if the substring is palindrome. Other wise its false. To calculate table[i][j], we first check the value of table[i + 1][j], if the value is true and str[i] is same as str[j], then we make table[i][j] true. Otherwise table[i][j] is false.
