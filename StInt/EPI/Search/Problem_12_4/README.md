Design an efficient algorithm for finding the position of the smallest element in a cyclically sorted array. Assume that all elements are distinct.

An array is said to be cyclicaly sorted if the smallest element in the array is at an index i and the sequence <A[i], A[i + 1], A[i + 2]....A[n - 1], A[0], A[1]> is such that A[0] .. A[1] is an increasing sequence that continues from A[i] onwards.

eg. 378, 478, 550, 631, 103, 203, 220, 234, 279, 368
