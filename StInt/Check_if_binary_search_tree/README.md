Write a function to check if the tree is a binary serach tree or not. 
--> WRONG APPROACH: Check if the the left child of every node is smaller than the node value and the right child of every node is larger than the node value. 

--> RIGHT APPROACH: Do an inorder traversal of the tree, if the list is sorted in an ascending order. If so, voila.
