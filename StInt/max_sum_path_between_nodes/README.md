Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another.
The maximum sum path may or may not go through root. For example, in the following binary tree, the maximum sum is 27(3 + 6 + 9 + 0 â€“ 1 + 10). Expected time complexity is O(n).

tree

A simple solution is to traverse the tree and do following for every traversed node X.
1) Find maximum sum from leaf to root in left subtree of X (we can use this post for this and next steps)
2) Find maximum sum from leaf to root in right subtree of X.
3) Add the above two calculated values and X->data and compare the sum with the maximum value obtained so far and update the maximum value.
4) Return the maximum value.
