Start with a standard double linked list. Now imagine that in addition to the next and the previos pointers, each elements has a chils pointer which mau or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure. 

Flatten the list sp that all the nodes appear as a single level doubly linked list.
